# TIcTakToe


# Introduction
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This project is a classic implementation of the well-known Tic-Tac-Toe (or Noughts and Crosses) game. It's a simple yet fun game that can be played by two players taking turns to mark their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This repository is the perfect place to explore and understand how to build a basic game using a programming language of your choice. Feel free to contribute, learn, or use this code as a foundation for your own game development projects.
